# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using HTML , Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS framework .

## About the game

The game's first page is a main menu which gives the user options to choose whether he wants to play a single player game or two player game .

### Single Player Mode

This mode is still under construction . The main concept would be to make user compete again an intelligent bot ( a never loosing bot ) .

### Two Player Mode

This mode is in working condition . Here the user can compete with his friends and the flow of the game is turn based .


### Instructions

The Instructions are still not written ( as if anyone's going to see the instructions for how to play Tic-Tac-Toe :laughing:) .

## Whats more !!

1. Working on a feature which would give the option to the players who gets to go first ( under development will be soon added ) .
2. Adding proper instructions .
3. Adding better transitions between the pages .
4. Dark/Light mode .
5. Adding options to select different themes .
6. Adding audio's and random messages .

### Future scope 

The final step could be to make it a fully functional deployable app so that two users are able to play the game from their repective places ( respective devices ).
